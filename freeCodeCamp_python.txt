// Installing Python
        downlaod from the website
        python2 - legacy version 
        python3 - newest version, actively maintained
        Run the installer


// Choosing a text-editor
        Some IDEs are specifically for Python
        PyCharm is one of the most popular ones
        jetbrains.com/pycharm
                the community version is free and open source


// First program - "Hello World"
        Configure > Preferences > Theme
        Create new project
                select the python version 3 as your interpreter

        print("Hello World") - anything in here is printed to the console


// Drawing a shape!

print("   /|")  prints each line one at a time
print("  / |")  will print IN ORDER
print(" /  |")
print("/___|")


// Variables and Data Types

variable = a container to hold some data

separate words in a variable with an underscore
        e.g. character_name = "John"
             print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ", ")
                                add pluses in line to continue the string

"Strings" = plain text
Numbers = numbers (integers and float)
Boolean = TRUE / FALSE


// Working with Strings
        need "" around your strings
        \n - will insert a new line in the string (inside the ""!)
        \" - will "escape" the ". 'I literally want to print a "'
        concatenation - adding one string to another, like in the character_name example

        phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
        print(phrase.lower())       # lower() makes it all lower case
        print(phrase.upper())       # upper() makes it all upper case

        print(phrase.isupper())     # returns boolean value, checking if it's all in upper case
        print(phrase.upper().isupper())     # set all upper, checks if it's all upper, returns boolean

        print(len(phrase))          # get the length of the string

        print(phrase[0])            # get the first character of the string
                                    # PYTHON IS A ZERO INDEX LANGUAGE, i.e. the first value is 0, not 1

        print(phrase.index("a"))    # returns 3 because that's where that letter appears first in the string
        print(phrase.index("Acad")) # returns 8 because that's where the chunk appears in the string
        
        print(phrase.replace("Giraffe", "Elephant")     # replaces the whole word Giraffe with the whole world Elephant
